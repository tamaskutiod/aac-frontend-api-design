# API endpoint design and examples for AAC Frontend

The goal of this repo is to create a space for storing desings for the REST API for the [aac-frontend](https://github.com/OetkerDigital/aac-frontend) repositiory.

The JSON files uploaded here can be used as mock-data and we can discuss the API specs in pull requests.

The `*.ts` files in the `/modals` folder represent the data structures as interfaces or types. For example optional fields and data types are described and also have some addtional comments on the backend logic, since these can not be represented in JSON.

Also these models can be reused in the `aac-frontend` app to have proper typings for the API data.
